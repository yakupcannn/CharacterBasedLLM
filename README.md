# CharacterBasedLLM

## Summary Of The Project
In this project , I learned how to implement simple "Character Level LLM" from scratch . This helps to understand how the Big LLM Models work.The basic idea is we give an one or two or multiple character sequences and then Character Level Model tries to guess next character using probabilistic method.
